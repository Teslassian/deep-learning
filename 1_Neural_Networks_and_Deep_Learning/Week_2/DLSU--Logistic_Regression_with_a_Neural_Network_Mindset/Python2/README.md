# Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_Mindset
The focus of this project is to work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks by creating a logistic classifier for cat vs non-cat datasets. Relevant concepts are Python, Logistic Regression, Numpy, Neural Networks.
